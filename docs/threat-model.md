# Threat model

Community extensions add an untrusted-code boundary. Wasmi runs without imports,
WASI or native handles, with compilation, fuel, stack, linear-memory and output
limits. Only explicitly granted, user-selected context crosses that boundary.
The host renders validated descriptions and requires Apply for composer changes;
plugins cannot dispatch arbitrary Discord commands. Optional app snapshots have
separate grants for account/conversation context, channel directory, ordinary loaded
timeline rows, members, presence, voice state, read state and local reading settings.
The host exposes bounded data only, never credentials or raw media. Typed navigation,
clipboard, notice, existing-call and reading-setting proposals require explicit user
confirmation and revalidation in the ordinary host control path. Background handlers
cannot emit proposals. Permission/account changes invalidate copied app context;
voice actions also bind the original call request. Catalog downloads use a separate
credential-free client with bounded bodies, validated/pinned public DNS results,
redirect checks and expected hashes/lengths. Consent binds the reviewed flag and
exact artifact hash, so a cancelled local import cannot substitute for a catalog
release. Catalog review and hashes do not eliminate host/runtime vulnerabilities
or protect against a compromised catalog maintainer. Local extension data is
unencrypted; same-user filesystem tampering is outside the Wasm sandbox.

Protect session credentials, private messages, draft integrity, account isolation and platform permissions. Trust Discord as the service endpoint, but validate transport origins, lengths and response shapes. Server authorization is authoritative.

Credentials are non-serializable, non-Clone, redacted, zeroized in owned Rust buffers where practical, and saved only through the OS credential store. Temporary copies exist inside HTTP/WebSocket/JS/platform engines; no universal memory-erasure claim is made. A password is never entered into a Rust form. The login bridge is limited to its own newly-created Discord webview and never searches other apps or profiles.

Threats addressed: redirected Authorization leakage, header injection, bot-session substitution, oversized REST/WebSocket input, partial-update corruption, stale session callbacks, uncontrolled queues, automatic ambiguous-write retries, disk account mixing, plaintext-token files and background data collection.

Open risks: unofficial Discord account policy; third-party login page or platform-engine compromise; native dependency supply chain; untested embedded challenge/QR handoff; local users/backups reading unencrypted SQLite; sophisticated permissions/event gaps; incomplete event/subscription coverage; Markdown/font/accessibility coverage; and OS keychain denial/unavailability. A voice downgrade to transport-only encryption stays connected and is shown to the user; unauthenticated members still fail closed.

Do not report secrets or raw HTTP/Gateway payloads. Error UI uses fixed categories. Default tests use synthetic markers and local transports. No live network account testing in CI.

Strict cargo-audit currently blocks release on transitive Linux GTK/glib advisory warnings: RUSTSEC-2024-0370 and RUSTSEC-2024-0429. No ignore list is configured. See the dependency audit.
